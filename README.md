## 💡 Motivation

This project was born out of a personal need: **to organize the chaos**. My desktop and my ideas were scattered, and I needed a tool to centralize my thoughts in one place.

Beyond solving a real productivity problem, **SecondBrain** is a conscious exercise in software engineering, where I applied best practices in architecture, component decoupling, and maintainable code.
